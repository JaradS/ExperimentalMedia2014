### Description ###

ofBook is a community-sourced book on openFrameworks.  It's intended it to be an overview of what you can do with openFrameworks: short, 25-page chapters on topics such as sound, graphics, etc. 

ofBook currently lives as a github [repository](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook).  A finished version of the book is not going to be released until mid-September, but we've got a pre-release website version of the book hosted online [here](www.bakercp.github.io/ExperimentalMedia2014).  Since the book isn't done yet, it's not the prettiest (especially the table of contents), but it's functional.

### Recommended Chapters ###

### Giving Feedback ###

Because this book is development, feedback on what does and does not work would be *super* helpful.  For now, the easiest way to give feedback is to post an issue on the ExperimentalMedia2014 repository ([here](https://github.com/bakercp/ExperimentalMedia2014/issues)).  Create a new issue, call it something like "ofBook Chapter Name Feedback" and dump your thoughts.  If someone has already created an issue for the chapter you want to give feedback for, open up that issue and post your thoughts there.

At some point during the class, we will collect all of that feedback and send it over to the ofBook repository.
