1. Expand `ParticleSystemWithClassExtended`.
    - Create an additional class (like `SquareParticle` that is drawn differently).
    - Create an additional class that has a different physics behaviors (i.e. it moves differently than the base class).

2. Expand `ParticleSystem3D` in the same way that you extended part one (both physically and visually).

In both cases, you will create a sub-class.  Use the `SquareParticle` as a model of how to create a sub class.  In both cases, you will create particles in the `void setup()` function (as demonstrated in both examples).
